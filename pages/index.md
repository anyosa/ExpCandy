## Advices

### Reading papers 📑

- You do not need to read the whole paper always. Check this if you are interested in [how to read a paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/1273445.1273458?casa_token=hFk2RjmkH50AAAAA:M4XqTF39CjM8F0jmrvyCncElNysNE8bfm-KcAOGzTEjh1UvJO3e3PkfyqZbLxAqXozcJEFFq3K4).

### Writing ✍️

- Bad writing is better than no writing. 
- Do not wait for inspiration.
- You can start by something simple as *describing a figure*.

### Submissions 📄

- It is always a good idea to check the submission guidelines of the journals in which you want to publish. Like [these guidelines](https://www.springer.com/journal/10596/submission-guidelines).

### Supervisor 🧙

- If you schedule a meeting, prepare for it. Report results, ask questions or simply catch up with your supervisor in case personal situations should be communicated.
- When I want to report new results or have a question that is difficult to 'visualize' I prepare plots. These plots help with the communication of these ideas.
- You can also have an agenda for the meeting to avoid forgetting topics you want to talk about.
- If you wonder what is expected of a PhD from the point of view of a supervisor you can check content oriented to supervisors like [this guide](https://www.ithinkwell.com.au/ebooks/ebook-supervising-phd-students).

### Productivity 📈

- 2 minutes rule: If you can do it in two minutes, do it!
- Find your own productivity workflow. Check todoist's [blog](https://blog.doist.com/) to have a better idea about these workflows.

### Coding 💻

- First make it work. Second make it beautiful and/or run faster.
