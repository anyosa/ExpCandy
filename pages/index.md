## Advices

### Reading papers

- You do not need to read the whole paper always. Check this if you are insterested in [how to read a paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/1273445.1273458?casa_token=hFk2RjmkH50AAAAA:M4XqTF39CjM8F0jmrvyCncElNysNE8bfm-KcAOGzTEjh1UvJO3e3PkfyqZbLxAqXozcJEFFq3K4).

### Writing

- Bad writing is better than no writing. 
- Do not wait for inspiration.
- You can start by something simple as *describing a figure*.

### Supervisor

- If you schedule a meeting, prepare for it. Report results, ask questions or simply catch up with your supervisor in case personal situations should be communicated.
- When I want to report new results or have a question that is difficult to 'visualize' I prepare plots. These plots help with the communication of these ideas.
- You can also have an agenda for the meeting to avoid fogetting topics you want to talk about.
- If you wonder what is expected of a PhD from the point of view of a supervisor you can check content oriented to supervisors like [this guide](https://www.ithinkwell.com.au/ebooks/ebook-supervising-phd-students).
